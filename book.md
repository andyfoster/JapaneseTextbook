# Japanese Textbook

Japanese is a simple language with a crazy number of Chinese-characters to learn and a mind-bending way of ordering their sentences.
Simple verb conjugations, easy pronunciation, an quick-to-learn alphabet, and a lot of English loan-words make Japanese a lot easier than
you think. You'll have to spend a long time learning the former things, but the latter are a huge help

Many concepts from English aren't present in Japanese or take a completely different form. The key to Japanese is understanding their verbs.
Fortunately, similar to Japanese society, their verbs follow strict rules in conjugation.

The first thing you need to know is how the alphabet works. There's amisconception that Japanese has 3 alphabets. That isn't quite true. 
It's like saying that English has two alphabets - the upper and lower-case versions of each letter. The "two" alphabets in Japanese are just 
two versions of saying the same sound. They even look similar in a lot of cases. Hiragana is the main one and Katakana is used for foreign words
like Coca Cola, and often in advertising for emphasis.

THe key to understanding Japanese verb conjugations and pronunciation is understanding the alphabet and phoneme system. You should try to 
learn all these as soon as possible, but for now, just wrap your head around the layout.

THere are 5 vowel sounds in Japanese. Japanese is phonetic so the words are always pronounced as they are written. No surprises.
he vowels are A, I, U, E, O and rhyme with fAr, mEEt, mOO, gEt, hellO respectively.

The majority of the Japanese phonemes are a consonant paired up with vowel in two or three letter combinations: 
su-shi, sa-mu-rai, yo-ko-ha-ma, tsu-na-mi

Some exceptions: 
Some letters have become a different sound over time. 
The character for TI should be pronounced TEE but is pronounced and usually written as CHI (CHEEse).
Likewise, TU has become TSU as in tsu-na-mi. You might see it written as TU but it's not said like that anymore.d si an
And SI has become SHI  su-shi, ge-i-sha

N is the onlyy consonant that stands by itself. ko-n-ni-chi-wa. 
When you see a double consonant like this, just say the consonant sound for a bit longer.

In writing, they do a small TSU symbol in front of the sound to be pressed on. nippon, bakkari, wakkaru

There can also be two vowels in a row. For Japanese words, they put an U character second. This just means you say the first letter, even if
it's not a U for longer. Sometimes these words are written with a line above the letter (Tokyo, Toukyou,  とうきょう). In Katakana, they use a hyphen-like symbol
to show the lengthening (koo-hi) so you should be careful when putting dashes and Japanese together.

One more thing, they can put a small YA, YU or YO after the I line to make a xYA sound
ki + small ya = kya
ki+ smail yo = kyo

That's it for their alphabet.

You should learn to write all these with the correct stroke order. It's generallytop-to-bottom and left-to-right but it makes learning the rest of the alphabet a lot easier and it makes the handwriting easier to read. DOn't get into bad habits as you will be constantly corrected if Japanese people see you write them the wrong way.

Line one: The 1st Line (this one has no consonant)

| A | I | U | E | O |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| あ (a) | い (i) | う (u) | え (e) | お (o) |

compare this to the katakana line:

| A | I | U | E | O |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| ア (a) | イ (i) | ウ (u) | エ (e) | オ (o) |

Line Two: The Ka line

ka ki ku ke ko

Line Three: The Sa line

Sa Shi su se so

### Forms - Plain and Polite

People speak casually in the plain form and all the verb conjugations go from the plain form so you need to know the plain forms of the 
verbs. As a foreginer, people won't care if you're using the wrong form, as long as you're not trying to be rude, so do yourself a favor and
learn the version you need to use for the other forms. TO get a polite form from the plain is easy but it is impossible to work out the plain
form reliably if you only know the -masu version of the word. Learn the words like they show them in the dictionary.

### Particles
Word order is less important than the little "particles" you use after each word. This would be like saying "Me subject cake object eat".
In very casual conversation, the particles can be left out if it is obvious but you should learn them properly now.

### Nouns

### Adjectives

### Questions

Colons can be used to align columns.

| Tables        | Are           | Cool  |
| ------------- |:-------------:| -----:|
| col 3 is      | right-aligned | $1600 |
| col 2 is      | centered      |   $12 |
| zebra stripes | are neat      |    $1 |

There must be at least 3 dashes separating each header cell.
The outer pipes (|) are optional, and you don't need to make the 
raw Markdown line up prettily. You can also use inline Markdown.
